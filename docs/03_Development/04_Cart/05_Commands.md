## Expire Abandoned Carts via maintenance job
By default, this feature is disabled.
If you want to delete abandoned carts, you need to define an expiration date:

```yml
core_shop_storage_list:
  list:
    order:
      expiration:
        params:
          cart:
            days: 20
            params:
              anonymous: true
              customer: false

```
